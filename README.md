# Library Management System
 TU259 - OOP Final Project - Aisling Young
 This was my final project for my Object Oriented Software Development module.
 Using Python, I created a system with menus for staff and member users. It allows staff to update items from the catalogue, view overdue items, and update member details. It allows members to borrow and return items, as well as viewing their own outstanding borrowed items. 
 Members can also join the library or cancel their membership. Staff can add or remove members, and add or remove items.
